### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a mundane ML engineer and also a crypto player: SpikeX1989.cosmos.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web3 or AI projects, frontend and backend with Python, JS or go...
- ðŸ¥³ Fun fact: I got my English name Spike from Space Cowboy, and the Bio "Sic Parvis Magna" from Uncharted.
